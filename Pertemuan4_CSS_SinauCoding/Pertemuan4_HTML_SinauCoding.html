                <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Eius quos iusto corrupti aspernatur sunt
                    Phoenix di Valorant is told as someone who comes from England. Basically this character has a fire
                    element, so all his
                    moves have something to do with that element. This hero is very suitable to be used as a rusher
                    because of his ability.
                    The moves possessed by Phoenix: Curveball: Can fire a flare orb that can blind the enemy when in
                    range. </p>

                <p>
                    Oh yes, this
                    move needs to be directed to get perfect results. Hot hands: With this move Phoenix will present a
                    fireball which, if
                    thrown, will burn the ground. Use this move to slow down the enemy's movement. Blaze: With this move
                    Phoenix can create
                    a wall of fire that can block vision and deal damage when enemies pass through it. Run it back: This
                    is the ultimate
                    move from Phoenix. With this skill you can move to the opponent's location without fear of being
                    shot. Because if you
                    get shot you will return to the initial position when activating the move with a full HP
                    condition.Oh yes, this
                    move needs to be directed to get perfect results. Hot hands: With this move Phoenix will present a
                    fireball which, if
                    thrown, will burn the ground.
